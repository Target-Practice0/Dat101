      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[when the wake-up time is 7, the message is "I reached the buss in time". But when it is not 7, the message changes based on the specific time]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[when the wake-up time is 7, the message is "I reached the buss in time". But when it is not 7, the message changes based on the specific time]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[when the wake-up time is less than 7, the message is "I am still sleeping". When it is greater than 8, the message is "I missed the buss and train, so i have to drive."]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[when the number is exactly 0, the message is "The number is zero". Zero is neither positive nor negative.]</p>
